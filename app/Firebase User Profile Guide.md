1. Top-Level Collections
  - Users Collection: Contains documents for each user profile.
  - Posts Collection: Stores all posts made by users.
  - Followers Collection: Stores follow relationships.
  - Likes Collection: Stores likes on posts.
  - Comments Collection: Stores comments on posts.

Example Firestore Structure

```{json}
/collections
  /users
    /{userId}
      - username: "john_doe"
      - displayName: "John Doe"
      - profileImage: "path/to/profile_image.jpg"
      - bio: "Photographer & Traveler"
      - postCount: 120
      - followerCount: 500
      - followingCount: 300
      /posts   <-- A subcollection of the user's posts
        /{postId}
          - imageUrl: "path/to/image.jpg"
          - caption: "Enjoying the sunset"
          - createdAt: TIMESTAMP
          - likeCount: 120
          - commentCount: 30
  /posts
    /{postId}
      - userId: "john_doe"
      - imageUrl: "path/to/image.jpg"
      - caption: "Enjoying the sunset"
      - createdAt: TIMESTAMP
      - likeCount: 120
      - commentCount: 30
      /comments   <-- A subcollection of comments for this post
        /{commentId}
          - userId: "jane_doe"
          - text: "Beautiful!"
          - createdAt: TIMESTAMP
      /likes  <-- A subcollection of likes for this post
        /{userId}  <-- Simply the user's ID, no additional data needed.
  /followers
    /{userId}  <-- The user being followed.
      /followers   <-- Subcollection of followers
        /{followerId}  <-- Users who follow this user.
  /following
    /{userId}  <-- The user who is following others.
      /following  <-- Subcollection of users this person follows.
        /{followingId}  <-- ID of each user this person is following.
```

Collections and Documents

Users Collection

Each user in the app has a document in the users collection.
Each document represents a user profile and contains fields like username, displayName, profileImage, bio, and aggregated stats such as postCount, followerCount, and followingCount.
Example document:

```{json}
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "displayName": "John Doe",
  "profileImage": "path/to/profile_image.jpg",
  "bio": "Photographer & Traveler",
  "postCount": 120,
  "followerCount": 500,
  "followingCount": 300
}
```

Posts Collection

Each post a user creates is stored in a posts collection, either at the top level or as a subcollection within the user’s document.
Fields include imageUrl, caption, createdAt, likeCount, and commentCount.
Example document:

```{json}
{
  "userId": "john_doe",
  "images": [
    "path/to/image1.jpg",
    "path/to/image2.jpg",
    "path/to/image3.jpg"
  ],
  "caption": "Enjoying the sunset",
  "createdAt": "TIMESTAMP",
  "likeCount": 120,
  "commentCount": 30
}
```

If you prefer to store posts in the user's document, use a subcollection `/users/{userId}/posts/{postId}`.

Followers Collection

Each user has a followers collection to track their followers.
You could store just the followerId as a document ID in this collection for simplicity.
Example structure:

```{plaintext}
/followers/{userId}/followers/{followerId}
```

Following Collection

Similar to the followers collection, but it tracks the people a user follows.
Example structure:

```{plaintext}
/following/{userId}/following/{followingId}
```

Likes Collection

Each post has a subcollection called likes to track who has liked the post.
Each like document contains only the user’s ID or metadata if needed.
Example structure:

```{plaintext}
/posts/{postId}/likes/{userId}
```

Comments Collection

Posts can have a comments subcollection.
Each document contains the comment text, the userId of the commenter, and the timestamp.
Example document:

```{json}
{
  "userId": "jane_doe",
  "text": "Beautiful picture!",
  "createdAt": "TIMESTAMP"
}
```

Firestore Structure Best Practices
Denormalization (Avoid Joins):

Firestore encourages denormalization since it’s a NoSQL database.
For example, store likeCount and commentCount directly in the post document to avoid counting likes and comments every time the post is fetched.
Subcollections for Related Data:

Use subcollections for related data. E.g., store comments as a subcollection of posts, and posts as a subcollection of users.
Aggregated Fields:

Store aggregate counts such as followerCount, followingCount, likeCount, and commentCount directly in documents to minimize reads. These can be updated via Cloud Functions when a follower/like/comment is added or removed.

Use `startAfter()` for Pagination:

Use pagination techniques like `limit()` and `startAfter()` to fetch a limited number of posts, followers, or comments at a time, minimizing the number of reads.
Indexes for Queries:

Firestore creates indexes automatically, but for complex queries (like sorting posts by createdAt), you may need to manually create composite indexes.
Example Structure for Efficiency:
Users Collection:

```{plaintext}
/users
  /{userId}
    - username
    - displayName
    - bio
    - profileImage
    - postCount
    - followerCount
    - followingCount
```

Posts Collection (as a Subcollection of Users):

```{plaintext}
/users/{userId}/posts
  /{postId}
    - imageUrl
    - caption
    - createdAt
    - likeCount
    - commentCount
```

Followers/Following Collection:

```{plaintext}
/followers/{userId}/followers/{followerId}
/following/{userId}/following/{followingId}
```

Likes and Comments Subcollections (inside each post):

```{plaintext}
/posts/{postId}/likes/{userId}
/posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}
```

This flexible and hierarchical structure should help you model the Instagram-like app efficiently with reduced read counts.
